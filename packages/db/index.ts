/**
 * PRISMA CLIENT SINGLETON PATTERN
 * 
 * This implementation prevents multiple Prisma Client instances during development
 * hot reloading, which can cause:
 * - Connection pool exhaustion
 * - "Too many connections" errors
 * - Memory leaks
 * - Performance degradation
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. In development: Store the instance on globalThis to persist across hot reloads
 * 2. In production: Create a new instance normally (no hot reloading concerns)
 * 3. Use ?? operator to reuse existing instance or create new one
 * 
 * BENEFITS:
 * - ‚ôªÔ∏è  Reuses existing connections during hot reload
 * - üöÄ Better development performance
 * - üîß Prevents connection exhaustion
 * - ‚úÖ Clean production builds
